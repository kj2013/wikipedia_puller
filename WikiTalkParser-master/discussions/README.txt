level   	-> level of indentation (negative numbers represent structural nodes, level 1 represents comments which are not a reply to another comment)
article 	-> id of the article to which the discussion is associated (see list of ids and corresponding titles in file "article_titles.csv"). Negative numbers represent articles for which we do not know the official id in Wikipedia
discussion      -> id of the talk page in which the comment was written (there can be more talk pages associated to the same article)
timestamp       -> UNIX timestamp in minutes: multiply for 60 to get the value in seconds (the standard epoch timestamp). 0 for structural nodes, -1 for undated comments

parent_author   -> id of the parent comment's author
author_name     -> author's user name
parent_author_name -> user name of the parent comment's author
date    	-> date (string)
text		-> text of the comment. To write one comment per line, newlines (\n) have been replaced with "	<LF>	" and tabs (\t) with "  <TAB>  ". Structural nodes: texts delimited by <> represent articles' and talk pages' titles, while texts delimited by "=" represent thread titles. The other texts represent comments, where signature and date have been removed.
