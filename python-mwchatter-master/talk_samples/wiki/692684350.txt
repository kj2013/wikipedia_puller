== Evidence tampering ==

SPI pages have a section for evidence to be adduced by those alleged to be sockpuppets.   It should be obvious that evidence submitted prior to the determination of the case is validly posted, and not to be deleted on the ground of block evasion.   However, some editors have been doing just that.   Should the blocking policy be amended to make it clear that this is not allowed? [[Special:Contributions/86.134.217.107|86.134.217.107]] ([[User talk:86.134.217.107|talk]]) 10:04, 18 August 2015 (UTC)

== Privacy VPN blocks ==

I noticed I can't edit when I have PIA VPN running, even when logged in.  It seems somewhat counterproductive to turn on SSL globally in order to enhance privacy, and then to block the use of privacy VPNs even for logged in users.   Is this an exceptional instance, or do we have an actual policy somewhere to block privacy VPNs even for logged in users?   [[User:Gigs|Gigs]] ([[User talk:Gigs|talk]]) 01:30, 10 September 2015 (UTC)
::This is a bit stale, {{U|Gigs}}, but I doubt this is policy, or even an intended effect. I suspect this is an unintended collision of software, and I would raise it at [[WP:VPT]] if it is still going on. Or it might be intended from the other side. A VPN I use does prevent me from accessing some sites, although not Wikipedia. I don't know anything about the PIA VPN, but it might somehow block the URLs associated with editing.

::The section is titled "Common rationales for blocks" not "common policies upon which blocks are based."

:::The discussion is whether to ''add'' it, not keep it. And it's not actually policy; we don't actually block folks for things they don't do, we block them for things they do. Consider "Mary & Slater-4eva," created 2007. Clearly "not here" to build an encyclopedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log/Mary_%26_Slater-4eva], yet no one going to block them.

Can someone please list here all rationales which are hinted by software?

*The complete dropdown menu  of 40 or so common rationales is at [[MediaWiki:Ipbreason-dropdown]]. It looks like NOTHERE was added about 16 months ago (in response to the many admins who were already manually using it as a block summary), there was a brief discussion on the talk page, and it was decided to keep it.  Like all MediaWiki pages it is permanently protected to stop people from rushing in and messing it up without a consensus to do so, so please make sure you have a consensus to remove it  before seeking to change that. [[User:Beeblebrox|Beeblebrox]] ([[User talk:Beeblebrox|talk]]) 02:03, 31 October 2015 (UTC)

* The problem is this reason encourages lazy or sloppy administrating.  I'm guilty of having used it a few times without thinking.  When blocking, specifics should be provided with a citation to policy or a guideline.  [[WP:NOTHERE]] includes a bunch of stuff that isn't blockable.  It's too easy to look at an account you don't like and say "not here" and block it.  What's wrong with giving a specific reason: vandalism, sneaky vandalism, edit warring, creating hoaxes, improper username, [[WP:POINT]], [[WP:DE]] or something else ''specific''?  The problem with "not here" is that it presumes to judge the user's motive.  What we really need to do is block for their actions, regardless of motive.

**I think all the bullets at [[WP:NOTHERE]] are good reasons for blocking, provided you've attempted to explain the issue to the user yet they continue with disruptive behaviour – to a degree that we can definitely say the user is "not here to contribute". Any admin who is just blocking users without any real reason is just being a poor administrator, the little dropdown of presupplied block summaries is not to blame, nor do they govern what the valid reasons for blocking are.{{pb}}I also use this summary for when the account is not vandalism-only, but deserving of an indefinite block. For instance, if they make a few good edits to disguise their trolling or other obvious disruption, particularly when there's an extensive filter log indicative of abuse. "Disruptive editing" of course can work just as well, but it does not imply an indefinite block. This use case for me is for newer accounts and not for controversial blocks, where you might want to give more specific rationale <span style="font-family:sans-serif">&mdash; <span style="font-weight:bold">[[User:MusikAnimal|<span style="color:black; font-style:italic">MusikAnimal</span>]] <sup>[[User talk:MusikAnimal|<span style="color:green">talk</span>]]</sup></span></span> 23:03, 1 November 2015 (UTC)

***Also "disruptive editing" and "vandalism" blocks may be a result of specific edits, where NOTHERE can be more fitting when blocking for an overall behaviourial issue. In the end it's at the discretion of the administrator, and any good admin will use NOTHERE where appropriate and not leave the user unaware of why they were blocked, or have other admins questioning it. The keyword I think is that the user is ''clearly'' not here, such that others will agree <span style="font-family:sans-serif">&mdash; <span style="font-weight:bold">[[User:MusikAnimal|<span style="color:black; font-style:italic">MusikAnimal</span>]] <sup>[[User talk:MusikAnimal|<span style="color:green">talk</span>]]</sup></span></span> 23:18, 1 November 2015 (UTC)
****[[WP:DE]] nutshell: "Disruptive editors may be blocked or banned indefinitely." I've observed blocks labeled "not here" for at least a year or two -- whenever I look into the circumstances it's generally actually been disruptive editing or personal attacks. Complaining to a blocking admin that they made a reasonable block but recorded the wrong reason struck me as pointlessly bureaucratic, so I never worried about it. <small>[[User talk:NE Ent|NE Ent]]</small> 00:18, 2 November 2015 (UTC)
*****Why are we using blobs? An administrator blocks for one day for alleged "block evasion". Another administrator, whose motive is to punish the editor for being good at her job, comes along and increases that by 5,800%. He needs a reason for doing that, but as she is blameless doesn't have one. He therefore synthesises a reason, "continued abuse", which is not permitted under policy and rightly so. Should the policy be amended to make it clear that administrators who use these weasel words are guilty of abuse of the tools?

* The [[WP:NOTHERE]] page has a list with a preamble, "Indications that a user clearly may not be here to build an encyclopedia include."  When blocking, I think we should cite the specific reason, not point to a vague list.  Some items on the list are not block worthy, such as "Interest in gaining as many rights or "flags" as possible"  If we blocked for that, I could indef {{ping|Kirill Lokshin}} or {{ping|AGK}} right now, for example.  It also lists "Narrow self interest and/or promotion" and mentions [[WP:SPA]].  Many new editors appear to have a narrow focus or start out with self promotion.  Last I checked, we don't block single purpose accounts unless they are disruptive.  There are really only two basic reasons to block:  (1) damaging articles, and (2) severely annoying other users.   In the block tool interface we list a bunch of different flavors of those two basic violations.  Why then do we need to list "NotHere", which is less specific than either of the two basic reasons to block?  Let's be specific. [[User:Jehochman|Jehochman]] <sup>[[User talk:Jehochman|Talk]]</sup> 03:03, 2 November 2015 (UTC)
**"I could indef Kirill Lokshin or AGK right now, for example." <- no common sense. "Blocking a 4chan troll as they're not here to improve the encyclopedia" <- common sense.

*** Admins are humans, and humans are biased. We've '''all''' seen admins abuse their powers, and we've all seen admins get tossed out. Popularizing the usage of the highly interpretive and vague NOTHERE rationale ''instead'' of the more concrete reasons that Jehochman suggests is really fostering a rationale that is more likely to be improperly applied/abused/misinterpreted.

***No, I meant that we've all seen admins tossed from the project (for various reasons), so not all admins can always automatically be trusted implicitly to do the right thing because admins are not infallible by default. Especially when there's extra "wiggle room" to block users. I never meant to imply that any admin has been tossed, or even disciplined, for NOTHERE usage. This is an example of how generalizations can be misunderstood! NOTHERE is not policy, and it's rife for misinterpretation. The only other information page that admins should(?) use for a block rationale [[MediaWiki:Ipbreason-dropdown|here]] appears to be [[WP:VOA|VOA]], which is directly tied to a policy. All other rationales are either guidelines or policy. NOTHERE starts out with ''"A major pillar of Wikipedia is that editors are here purely to build an encyclopedia"''. So... what "major pillar" is that?! It doesn't even make sense, which is why it is not policy.
**:There's also this: if anything, admins should link to [[WP:NOT]] instead of NOTHERE. Why? Because '''that''' is actually policy! Not some information page.

****The pillar is [[WP:5P4]] which incorporates [[WP:AGF]]. And admins can use customized reasons when blocking if appropriate. [[WP:NOTHERE]] is one of them.

***The 4th pillar [[WP:CIV]] has nothing in that policy that states "editors are here purely to build an encyclopedia".

I frequently post a block notice on a user's talk page which says something like "you have been blocked because you are clearly here not to contribute to the encyclopaedia, but rather in order to..." and then goes on to give further details. In many situations, I regard that as more helpful than just saying "You are blocked because you are not here to contribute to the encyclopaedia", unless prior existing context makes it clear what the more detailed reason is. That is exactly analogous to what applies in the case of most other block reasons: "You have been blocked for edit-warring on such and such an article in such and such circumstances" is better than just "You have been blocked for edit-warring", unless previous messages make the details unambiguous already. However, frequently the essential reason for a block is that the editor's purpose here is something other than contributing to the encyclopaedia. Typically, an editor comes here for some unsuitable purpose (such as using Wikipedia to publish his or her own made-up fictitious country, or using a user page as a blog), he or she is politely told that doing so is not what Wikipedia is for, he or she persists, is told again more firmly, persists again, and is then blocked. It seems to me that in such a situation he or she is being blocked substantially because he or she is here not to contribute to the encyclopaedia, but rather for some other purpose, and that being so, it makes sense to say so in the block log. Very often, none of the other common reasons quite fits, so if administrators were forbidden to give that as a block reason, granted that a block log rationale has to be fairly short and concise, the result would be that often a less accurate, and possibly misleading, reason, would be given. I don't agree that every blocking rationale needs to link to a policy, but I do agree that in some ways linking to the page [[WP:NOTHERE]] is not ideal. However, whether we should link to that page is a quite separate issue from whether it is reasonable to give "not being here to contribute to the encyclopaedia" as a reason for blocking. I agree with [[User:NeilN|NeilN]] that not being here to contribute to the encyclopaedia is a clearer reason than the extremely vague "disruptive editing".

As I have attempted to indicate above, there are situations in which not being here to contribute is the essential reason for a block. Since being here for a purpose other than contributing to the encyclopaedia is frequently the most natural reason for a block, it is therefore reasonable for administrators to block for that reason. Moreover, ''whether people in this discussion agree that it is reasonable or not, it '''''is''''' in fact one of "the most common rationales for blocks"'', so it makes sense that it should be included in the list of "Common rationales for blocks". We don't have to link to [[WP:NOTHERE]] if consensus is against doing so, and certainly I am far from persuaded that doing so is a good idea. Just adding some wording such as "Not being here to contribute to the encyclopaedia", perhaps with a sentence or so clarifying it, would be reasonable. For those who think that every block should refer to a policy, the objection that "not here to contribute" is not a policy would then be answered, because it would be included in the blocking policy. <small>''The editor who uses the pseudonym''</small> "[[User:JamesBWatson|JamesBWatson]]" ([[User talk:JamesBWatson#top|talk]]) 16:12, 2 November 2015 (UTC)

:  The block reason isn't the "not here", because we don't block users for what they haven't done; we block them for what they actually do.  The reason to block should be stated as "You did X" where X is against a policy or guideline.   The "Not here" statement is a fine preamble when giving an explanation, but it alone is not sufficient to justify a block.  Words matter.  We shouldn't have a template reason that is insufficient without further explanation; it could encourage less experienced admins to block too quickly and without sufficient rationale.

*I don't think anyone in this discussion is on their very first day of Wikipedia editing, but just in case, I would explain that when ''practices change'' policies and processes are adapted to the change, not used to shut down the change.
:TLDR version: policies are ''descriptive'' not ''postcriptive''.
:I realize that this fundamental concept which underlays how WP works has not been out in the forefront in this age of insistence on blnd obedience to "teh rulez" but how this happened is '''exactly how it is supposed to work here''' and insisting it be undone a year and a half later because an extremely small minority don't like how it came to be added is exactly how it ''is not'' supposed to work. Also, by my read we do have a consensus. Unanimity would be nice, but anyone can see that the bulk of particpants in thsi discussion support the inclusion of NOTHERE as a standard blocking rationale. Even if removed, you would need to get a consensus absolutely banning it as a reasson for blocking or admins could still just type in "NOTHERE" in about one second anyway.

*Policy is supposed to be descriptive, not prescriptive. The practice is that NOTHERE is used as a block rationale a lot, which makes that rationale policy with a small "p". The whole  point of a wiki format is that things are fluid, they change over time, and we don't need to waste our time ratifying every minor change in practice. This RfC is a total waste of time, and the question is a non-issue (I use the rationale frequently for trolls, for example). But since we're here: Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia; our purpose as Wikipedians is to write and maintain it. Anything else should go somewhere else, and anyone whose edits don't contribute to that aim should be shown the door. That doesn't mean we have to be arseholes about it, but if somebody shows no interest in anything other than promoting their company/recording grandad's war stories/using Wikipedia as a webhost/re-fighting ancient wars/pushing a nationalist POV/etc etc, and we can't get them to stop voluntarily, they should be blocked and "NOTHERE" is as good an explanation for such a block as anything.

***So for an indefinite block the ''essay'' should be used for the blocking rationale, and for a temporary block the ''policy'' should be linked for the blocking rationale. Makes sense. Are there any other essays besides this one and [[WP:VOA]] that should used when blocking over policies and guidelines? Right at [[WP:ESSAY]] it states: ''"Essays have no official status, and do not speak for the Wikipedia community as they may be created without approval."'' Is this correct?

*'''Support''' [[WP:NOTHERE]] as a legitimate, policy-based block reason. I have no idea why this is controversial. It's 100% appropriate for cases where users violate more than one community norm, for example, edit warring to repeatedly insert antisemitic material into articles about the [[Holocaust]]; sneaky vandalism while making personal attacks on editors who revert the vandalism; forum talk on article talk pages while repeatedly adding unsourced content to the articles; inciting discord by making trifling complaints at ANI, supported by obvious meat puppets from 4chan; using multiple IP addresses and proxies in the Ukraine to push an agenda that Nikola Tesla was Croatian, not Serbian. [[WP:NOTHERE]] closely aligns with our core purpose expressed in [[WP:NOT]]: "Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia and, as a means to that end, an online community of individuals interested in building and using a high-quality encyclopedia in a spirit of mutual respect."

# I echo the comments from more than one editor above about unnecessarily repeating the discussion. ''"The matter of policy change should not be in the hands of 2-3 a handful of regulars"'' could well be seen as an attempt at [[WP:FORUMSHOP|forum shopping]]: "I wanted to get my way by having a discussion among the few editors who turn up to this page to discuss the matter, but when I realised that I wasn't going to get my way by that method, I decided to move the goal posts and try to get my way by a different method."
# Some of the arguments against use of "not here to contribute to the encyclopaedia" make little or no sense. Here are a few examples: (1) ''"We don't actually block folks for things they don't do, we block them for things they do."'' That is empty sophistry: obviously the way we come to the conclusion that an editor is not here to contribute to the encyclopaedia is that ''we observe them '''doing things''' other than contributing to the encyclopaedia''. (2) Editors keep on harping on about the status of [[WP:NOTHERE]] as "not a policy". However, arguing that something should not be accepted because it isn't a policy is nonsense for at least two reasons. Firstly, many thing we do are not policies, and trying to turn Wikipedia into some sort of bureaucracy, where nothing can be done unless sanctioned by a written policy, is not helpful. Secondly, if there is consensus that the current practice is acceptable, then it can be added to the blocking '''POLICY''' if editors want every acceptable practice to be sanctioned by a policy. Arguing that we should not add it to a policy because it isn't policy is pure nonsense. (And, for the benefit of anyone who is unaware of the relevant history, this string of discussions was started because of editors wishing to add it to the blocking policy.) (3) ''"I cannot accept the fact the admins base their actions on an essay which contains some questionable advice"''. When did any administrator "base their actions on" that page? As far as I am concerned, I block people because it is clear that their editing does more harm than good to the project: if the particular manner in which that manifests itself indicate that they are here for some purpose other than contributing to the encyclopaedia, then it seems to me reasonable to say so; that does not mean that I am "basing" the decision to block on the existence of that page. If the page didn't exist, I would still be blocking the editor.
# I have already said the following (albeit not in the same words) in the first discussion about this, above, and I find it unconstructive that a second and a third discussion on the same question have been started, but to avoid any risk that anyone assessing this third discussion may overlook what was said in the first one, I shall say it again: '''Blocking an editor because he or she is substantially here for reasons other than to contribute to the encyclopaedia is reasonable. When an editor is blocked for that reason, it is reasonable for the administrator to state that it is for that reason. Trying to forbid administrators from doing so is ridiculous.''' <small>''The editor who uses the pseudonym''</small> "[[User:JamesBWatson|JamesBWatson]]" ([[User talk:JamesBWatson#top|talk]]) 16:59, 3 November 2015 (UTC)
::*You say ''"If the page didn't exist, I would still be blocking the editor".'' Let's pretend for a second that the page really didn't exist. You'd be blocking the editor for... what reason? It can't just be "clearly not being here to build an encyclopedia", obviously. There would have to be some concrete reason in a policy or a guideline that you could point to, every time, to justify the block.

::* re shouting: ''"Trying to forbid administrators from doing so is ridiculous"'' - straw man argument. Nobody can forbid admins to do what they see fit broadly understanding the good of wikipedia. We are discussion here whether and how to expand the existing policy, so that  "what they see fit" to involve less personal decision and more commonly accepted practice. {{Unsigned4|18:54, 3 November 2015‎|Staszek Lem}}
:::: It's not a "straw man argument". Of course the editors who are plugging this know they can't actually "forbid" administrators from doing it, but their intention is to put administrators off doing so. I am way past thinking it worth spending time making sure that my wording are absolutely literal in every detail in this pointlessly-prolonged disruptive discussion. <small>''The editor who uses the pseudonym''</small> "[[User:JamesBWatson|JamesBWatson]]" ([[User talk:JamesBWatson#top|talk]]) 19:28, 3 November 2015 (UTC)

*One more point, which I have mentioned before, but which perhaps could do with emphasising. It seems to me that in these discussions at least two related but '''different''' questions are being confused together:
# Should "not being here to contribute to the encyclopaedia" be accepted as a reason for blocking?
# Should linking to the section of the page [[Wikipedia:Here to build an encyclopedia]] headed [[Wikipedia:Here to build an encyclopedia#Clearly not being here to build an encyclopedia]] (commonly abbreviated as [[WP:NOTHERE]]) be regarded as a good explanation of why an editor has been blocked?
*As I trust I have made clear by now, in my opinion the answer to the first question is "yes", if not "'''yes'''". However, my answer to the second is "Hmm. Weeeell ... not ideal." I ask anyone posting here from now on to be careful to distinguish between these tow questions. Some of the arguments above seem to me to be arguments against linking to [[WP:NOTHERE]], but expressed in such a way as to suggest that their authors think that they are arguments against using "not here to contribute to the encyclopaedia" as a block reason, which is not at all the same thing. <small>''The editor who uses the pseudonym''</small> "[[User:JamesBWatson|JamesBWatson]]" ([[User talk:JamesBWatson#top|talk]]) 20:20, 3 November 2015 (UTC)
** No, there are more than two:
:# Is "not being here to contribute to the encyclopaedia" a reason for blocking? (of course not)
:# If an admin makes a proper block, e.g. for [[WP:DE]], but uses a "wrong" reason, e.g. [[WP:NOTHERE]], does anyone actually care (probably not), or should the faux pas be ignored per not bureaucracy? (of course).  More: It's kind of like the janitor's in the office where I work -- I just care they empty the trash and sweep the floor, don't really care how they do it, and if I started going around and saying "You're not emptying that trash can the right way!" that'd be seriously lame, right?
:#Should we invent a new bogus policy by linking a policy page to an essay? (nope) <small>[[User talk:NE Ent|NE Ent]]</small> 23:15, 3 November 2015 (UTC)
::* No, there are more than three. Now, please take a look at the very top: According to [[WP:RFC|RfC rules]] (AFAIU), the question was posted '''exactly''' about the contested edit of the policy. Despite the venom in my address from some, my purpose was to keep the discussion focused. While it is good that someone again brought our attention that the question is in fact a multipronged issue, the basic issue IMO remains single: if we are to add a new bullet or section in a ''policy'', it cannot remain ''vague''. (Vague issues of policy belong to [[WP:COMMONSENSE]] & [[WP:IAR]].) IMO we agree that the phrase "not here to build encyclopedia" is but a shortcut, a tad longer than "WP:NOTHERE", to describe a frolicking behavior with a number of petty violations which, when taken alone each seem insufficient for block. And the real definition of this must be in the appropriate guideline. ''Such a guideline is a must.'' Otherwise one can block 80% of editors in Israel-Palestine topics: An admin can say "you are here for pushing Jewish agenda and nothing else", while the person is genuinely convinced he is doing a Good Thing by fixing wikipedia from the recent European surge of anti-Semitism slowly trickling into wikipedia. Therefore, for the purpose of analysis you can split my question (and answers) into as many subcurrents as convenient, the question remains single: '''whether [[WP:NOTHERE]] be officially listed in the policy''', and all ramifications mentioned should be viewed as arguments ''pro'' and ''contra''. When we collect all opinions, we can decide whether the item is salvageable. [[User:Staszek Lem|Staszek Lem]] ([[User talk:Staszek Lem|talk]]) 00:26, 4 November 2015 (UTC)

*'''Simultaneously Support and Oppose for the same reason'''.  WP:NOTHERE is a perfectly valid reason to block someone; it's a subset of general disruptive behavior.  It's merely an explanation of the kind of disruptive behavior we're blocking someone for.  Per [[WP:CREEP]], [[WP:IAR]], it is neither desirable nor even possible to list, ahead of time, every single way a person may be disruptive.  So, yes, we should still block people who disrupt Wikipedia.

:*More observations: The drop-down also has an "Other" option, which when used allows the administrator to enter in any free-form reason they want to the block log's block summary – so admins are not limited to the reasons in [[MediaWiki:Ipbreason-dropdown]] (these are really just for convenience to save typing, a way to standardize the block log's summaries, and perhaps as a "crib sheet" to the most commonly used reasons supported by policy and guidelines). I note that the policy simply gives a list of "common rationales" for blocks, and only specifies a limited set of reasons for which ''[[Wikipedia:Blocking policy#When blocking may not be used|blocking may not be used]]''. So the blocking policy does not prohibit blocking for the reasons given in [[WP:NOTHERE]]. For that reason I've struck part of my original opinion.
::It appears that {{U|JamesBWatson}}'s implementation was bold. It was implemented shortly after he removed several links to deleted pages, and first used to block {{U|1kdhar}} ([[Special:DeletedContributions/1kdhar|9 deleted edits]]) within minutes of implementation. A reasonable notice was left on [[User talk:1kdhar]]. I guess my only quibble with this is that I'd rather see something like "Narrow self interest and/or promotion" and/or "Focusing on Wikipedia as a social networking site" left in the block-log summary. If we could replace the "not here" rationale with these other reasons, which are already included by consensus in the information page, then I think that might satisfy most of the opposition here. Now, if anyone thinks editors shouldn't be blocked for social networking, then that needs to be spelled out in the "When blocking may not be used" section of the policy.

*'''Support''' WP:NOTHERE is very useful both as a summary of opinion at a noticeboard like ANI and as a block reason.

What would you recommend for a case like this where several good editors get frustrated by having their time wasted cleaning up, and the editor will not communicate?

*****In the last 5,000 blocks (~ the past 5 days) I find about 29 "not here" blocks. There are indeed a number of different admins making them, so it is clearly a de facto accepted practice.

The second example had made potentially constructive edits, rendering "vandalism-only account" as a no-go, and "vandalism" while appropriate does not imply an indefinite duration, where NOTHERE does. <span style="font-family:sans-serif">&mdash; <span style="font-weight:bold">[[User:MusikAnimal|<span style="color:black; font-style:italic">MusikAnimal</span>]] <sup>[[User talk:MusikAnimal|<span style="color:green">talk</span>]]</sup></span></span> 17:31, 17 November 2015 (UTC)
*****:To clarify on my last point, Twinkle presets NOTHERE as indefinite, where if you chose Vandalism you'd have to select indefinite.

*****::<sigh> For 22nd time: the rationale is not questioned. The authority of admin to use ''any'' rationale is not questioned. The right of an admin to make a mistake is not questioned. The ''text of the essay'' is questioned as unfit for a policy. [[Wikipedia:Disruptive editing]] is a '''guideline''', which means it passeda rigorous scrutiny  (I sincerely hope) and several major rewrites.  WPNOTHERE is an essay 85% of single author (and 17 vandals :-). [[User:Staszek Lem|Staszek Lem]] ([[User talk:Staszek Lem|talk]]) 18:55, 17 November 2015 (UTC)
*****::A block "per NOTHERE" is essentially equivalent to a block "per [[WP:BP]]", as (I presume) nothing in the policy specifically is counter to anything in § Clearly not being here to build an encyclopedia. It's equivalent to a speedy deletion "per [[WP:CSD]]" (without specifying any specific CSD criteria). We don't really need to elevate the entire information page to guideline, just § Clearly not being here to build an encyclopedia, as that's all that could conceivably be used as a rationale for blocking – or perhaps only some of the ten elements in that section. If they were labeled '''NH1''' through '''NH10''', then the codes could be used as shorthand for the rationales, similar to speedy criteria '''G1''' through '''G13'''.

*'''Comment''':  Per {{U|MrX}}, NOTHERE is: '…a legitimate, policy-'''based''' block reason' (emphasis mine). NOTHERE is not a policy anymore than any other freely formulated apropriate blocking rationale. As per {{U|HJ Mitchell}}: {{green|they should be blocked and "NOTHERE" is as good an explanation for such a block as anything.}} {{U|JamesBWatson}} also sums it up perfectly with his boldend statement. We should guard against the bureaucracy of trying to include every possible action and infraction in those templated lists - Twinkle is already in such a confusing mess that very often even a hand written rationale is significantly quicker. What we have to undestand is that NOTHERE provides an essay which avoids having to paste its text or something similar into a block log where a reference to NOTHERE will suffice. A user whose editing patern is, or has clearly become, one that is no longer concerned with adding content, maintaining content or other aspect of the site, and is being used henceforth for inciviity, attacking other users, or posting strings of expletives, is IMHO, not or no longer on Wikipedia  in the best interests of the project and should be shown the door.

:If an admin opens that door and boots the user through it, it is not an abuse of sysop power, and any minor technical errors in doing so should be easily addressed without acrimony. Yesterday in an attempt to derail an Arbcom election, a candidate was accused of grave admin abuse by using NOTHERE as a possibly slightly inaccurate rationale. However, when a user is on a disruptive spree, s/he has to be stopped quickly and  to that  end ''any'' block rationale from  a drop-down of choices is reasonable provided the  actual  block is appropriate,  which  in this case  it was. It's really  very  bad faith  to  accuse an admin  of abuse and demand he relinquish  his tools for such  a minor error when just  genuinely  carrying  out  the tasks the community  gave him  the trust  to  do and where he has no other history of impropriety. To  project  such  a negative opinion loudly  into  other Wikipedia spaces and discussions is itself rather poor form.

:*This long comment by Kudpung is IMO a yet another reason why we need a clear policy here. The argument "one that is no longer concerned with adding content, maintaining content or other aspect of the site, and is being used henceforth for inciviity, attacking other users, or posting strings of expletives" is dubious in the part ''"no longer"'' How long the "no longer" should be? What was the reason of incivility? Was the person provoked that he could not do anything else but vent their frustration? Real people are not machines. Occasional outbursts happen. You do have to block them. Explain the real reason: disruption is intolerable; disagreements must be resolved in civilized way. But don't tell them they are basically a useless piece of shit and kick out forever. Kudpung is entitled to his strong opinion about disruptors and the ways he handles them, but I strongly object that his POV on NOTHERE be ''part of the policy''.

:::It's a great example of how off-base an interpretation of what being "here" actually is.

== Wiki 101 review ==
Since the above discussion is just a little ridiculous, let's review how we (should) work around here.
* Something's wrong, just fix it (bold)
* If you think a change isn't an improvement, revert and discuss.
* If you can't come to consensus through discussion, initiate RFC. Wait 30 days or so. Count votes. Position with more votes gets implemented.
Repeating yourself isn't likely to change anyone's mind, and '''repeating yourself in bold''' even less so. And try to keep in mind it's just a website, and what you're fussing about probably doesn't make that much difference either way. <small>[[User talk:NE Ent|NE Ent]]</small> 23:19, 3 November 2015 (UTC)

*A "small subset" may not be entirely accurate.

In total there have been 4794 NOTHERE blocks since August 2013 [http://quarry.wmflabs.org/query/6022].

re: ''"Any good rational whatsoever is fair game when an editor is blocked. There is no need for it to be documented somewhere."'' -- Two points: (1) yes a "good rationale" is good to have documented, for spread of good practice. (2) If there were infinite number of "good rationales", then documenting them all would be impractical. Fortunately this is not the case: People have a nifty thing called "abstract thinking" which allows them to classify infinite number phenomena into a finite set of concepts. Example: It is a good rationale: "I blocked you because you put the word 'penis' and "gay" into several articles". I am sure it is an extremely common editing; I remember reverting some myself. But nobody would suggest to put "Adding word ''penis'' into an article" into the policy. In our case of NOTHERE we are dealing with an ''abstract'' definition of a certain editing pattern, which can cover ''a big number'' of concrete behaviors. Therefore in my Book of Logic this is a valid example why NOTHERE deserves to be in the policy, unlike WP:DONT_PUT_PENIS_INTO_RANDOM_ARTICLES.

== Unblock conditions ==

For some time admins have been working in a limbo state where they are unblocking with conditions on further editing but don't have a policy basis to support them (see, for example, Worm's unblock of Kumioko and some resultant discussion). This will be even more important now that the Arbitration Committee has [[WP:ACN#Arbitration motion to disband the Ban Appeals Subcommittee|handed block and ban appeals back to the community]] to deal with. I propose that the following be added as a section under §Unblocking, I've based it on what I have observed of current practice:
{{ivmbox|<nowiki>===Conditional unblock===</nowiki><p>Administrators may, with the agreement of the blocked user, impose unblock conditions when unblocking an editor if the administrator is not comfortable that a complete unblock would be in the best interests of the project. Unblock conditions should be designed to prevent the behaviour which lead to the block occurring again (such as a page ban to prevent further edit warring).
*Any unblock conditions will expire at a time agreed to by the blocked user and administrator but must not exceed the original block expiry.
*Unblock conditions may include [[WP:PBAN|page]] or [[WP:TBAN|topic bans]], revert restrictions and single account restrictions.
*If editors breach unblock conditions they may be blocked or further restricted, but the block imposed must not exceed the original block expiry. <u>This does not prevent an administrator imposing other sanctions (such as a new block) if there is fresh misconduct, which breaches other policies and guidelines, not just the unblock conditions.</u>
*Unblock conditions may be appealed in the same way as a block (to the unblocking administrator, uninvolved administrators or to [[WP:AN|AN]]).
*Unblock conditions should be recorded on the user's talk page (in a notice which should not be removed while the conditions are active), linked to in the unblock reason and may be noted at [[Wikipedia:Editing restrictions#Final warnings / Unblock conditions]].}}

*Thank you for opening this discussion, which I do think we should be having (unlike some other discussions on this page) However, I forsee problems with the first two points:
:*Sometimes, someone is blocked for repeated disruptive behavior, let's say edit warring. Edit warring blocks are often quite short, one or two days. So the admin considering unblocking could suggest a 1RR restriction, but only for two days? Why even bother?
:*On the second point, who will be deciding what is proportional? Sounds like a mess waiting to happen. As the restrictions would be voluntary and the user has the right of appeal later on this seems unecessary. [[User:Beeblebrox|Beeblebrox]] ([[User talk:Beeblebrox|talk]]) 02:45, 17 November 2015 (UTC)
:::I've removed the bit about proportionality, thanks. If it's repeated misbehaviour then the blocks would be getting longer and longer as well so any unblock conditions would also be able to be longer. In the past the community has been very hesitant to give admins powers to impose restrictions on their own authority so I tried to make this reflect that. Consider this, a user is blocked twice for edit warring (second block for a week) and the reviewing admin will only unblock if they agree to an indef 1RR or ban from the article. If there is a longer term issue with the user being involved in edit warring then it would need to go ANI for a community imposed restriction outside of a normal block length. Hope may thinking makes sense. <b>[[User:Callanecc|Callanecc]]</b> ([[User talk:Callanecc|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Callanecc|contribs]] • [[Special:Log/Callanecc|logs]]) 02:52, 17 November 2015 (UTC)
::::[[User:Callanecc|Callanecc]], what's normal block length?

:::::That's a normal block length. My point was that this proposal does not and should not allow a single admin to impose a long-term or indef restriction after a short block (eg second block for a week). Instead the appeal (if no one wants to unblock without a long-term restriction) should go to ANI so that more than a single admin can decide what's needed. <b>[[User:Callanecc|Callanecc]]</b> ([[User talk:Callanecc|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Callanecc|contribs]] • [[Special:Log/Callanecc|logs]]) 02:29, 18 November 2015 (UTC)
*"If editors breach unblock conditions they may be blocked or further restricted, but the block imposed must not exceed the original block expiry." Not enamored with this. For example, if an editor is blocked for a week for BLP violations, is unblocked on the condition they won't touch the article, why can't I block for a month if they then go ahead and commit the same BLP violation? --[[User:NeilN|<b style="color:navy">Neil<span style="color:red">N</span></b>]] <sup>[[User talk:NeilN|<i style="color:blue">talk to me</i>]]</sup> 14:44, 17 November 2015 (UTC)
*:In that instance there discretionary sanctions which can be used, and they can be blocked for the BLP vio not just the unblock conditions. The reason I limited it to the original block length is that when a similar proposal went to the community (a while ago, don't remember specifics) there was a definitive no to allowing single admins to impose long-term restrictions on users. I'm hoping that the community will allow it in response to a block of the same length. <b>[[User:Callanecc|Callanecc]]</b> ([[User talk:Callanecc|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Callanecc|contribs]] • [[Special:Log/Callanecc|logs]]) 02:29, 18 November 2015 (UTC)
*I agree with Neil. I also think, as Beeblebrox implied, that the unblock conditions should be able to exceed the original block expiration. Even if there are no conditions, say an editor breaches 3RR and is blocked for 48 hours. The block expires, and in they shortly restore their version of the article at issue. As far as I'm concerned, I can block them ''and'' for longer without any "agreement".--[[User:Bbb23|Bbb23]] ([[User talk:Bbb23|talk]]) 22:56, 17 November 2015 (UTC)
*:Yes you could because that's for something more than just breaching their unblock conditions. Just as with discretionary sanctions you can add new sanctions on top of an already existing sanction is there is fresh misconduct. I've added a bit to clarify that. <b>[[User:Callanecc|Callanecc]]</b> ([[User talk:Callanecc|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Callanecc|contribs]] • [[Special:Log/Callanecc|logs]]) 02:29, 18 November 2015 (UTC)
*There are only really a handful of admins that handle the majority of unblock requests. It's often a lengthy process because the majority of unblock requests, the editor either fails to understand the unblock process (because they haven't read the relevant policies) or fall into [[WP:IDHT]]. They are after all (but not always) the most problematic and disruptive editors on the project. When an unblock is finally granted, very often the unblocking admin needs to check in on that editor at routine intervals. It's almost like being their case worker. I'm not saying this is the optimal solution, but it's what ends up happening. Admins need to be able to review the circumstances around a block and implement conditions whereby, hopefully, the reason for the initial block is not repeated. I think there could be an expiration time set for conditions, but it would be as open as up to one year. Sometimes admins have to deal with repeat offenders who have 3-6 previous blocks. Also, indefinite blocks would cause the additional problem of an editor having indefinite conditions set upon them. I don't think we should worry about the blocks that are one or two weeks long. If a set of conditions seem unreasonable or the editor is unwilling to agree to them, they can simply wait out the block. We really need to address long term conditions. They need to be able to be implemented and the edit needs to be free of them at a certain point. Lastly, I'm not crazy about the appeal process. We're going to run into [[WP:ADMINSHOP]] which we already experience at [[:Category:Requests for unblock]]. I think if an editor doesn't like the conditions at the time of their request, they should be able to request (up to one time) for another uninvolved admin to review their unblock request. If, for some reason, we end up having the appeal process, it's going to need to be clear that whoever grants the appeal and relieves the editor of their conditions or reduces them, then must adopt the editor. The reason being is that blocking and unblocking admins are often called back to comment on repeat offenders as they're familiar with the "case".

*We should mention interaction bans as an example of an unblock condition. I think there's still going to be opposition regarding the appeal process. I would go so far as to suggest that simply another unblock request should be submitted if they don't like the unblock conditions proposed the first time so another admin, familiar with the unblock process, will review and possibly offer a different set of conditions. We usually see multiple unblock requests anyway, so this appeal process will simply undergo that work plus new work at AN. The fundamental problem I've seen is that most people who request an unblock don't believe their unblock was justified in the first place. [[WP:AN]] might not work for technical reasons because they'll have to "agree" to the unblock conditions to get unblocked, and only then will be able to edit [[WP:AN]].

*'''Oppose''' proposed new wording is much worse than what the policy has said for a long time, which for the record is:

::"Blocks intended '''solely''' to "cool down" an angry user should ''not'' be used, as they often have the opposite effect. However, an angry user who is also being [[Wikipedia:Disruptive editing|disruptive]] can be blocked to prevent further disruption."

:(Emphasis ''not'' added, that is exactly how it appears in the policy) The intent seems to be well understood by the vast majority of admins.  [[User:Beeblebrox|Beeblebrox]] ([[User talk:Beeblebrox|talk]]) 02:48, 17 November 2015 (UTC)
::I am not suggesting a replacement; I am suggesting to add a clarification. The blocker cannot read your brain as to intentions, but they can read your text. [[User:Staszek Lem|Staszek Lem]] ([[User talk:Staszek Lem|talk]]) 03:01, 17 November 2015 (UTC)
:::It is not an instruction to blocked users, it is an instruction to admins considering blocking solely to cool someone down not do so. Unless there is some evidence that admins are misunderstanding this and making such blocks, your clarification would muddle what is, currently, perfectly clear.

::::Yes I know.  My point of clarification is related to the term "solely": that even you are blocking for real dusruption, do not make any personality hints (that you have to cool down, take a wikibreak, etc.)  [[User:Staszek Lem|Staszek Lem]] ([[User talk:Staszek Lem|talk]]) 03:26, 17 November 2015 (UTC)
::::::I'm sorry, but I do have no idea what "do not make any personality hints" means. I also still don't see why you want to clarify something when there is no reason to believe it isn't already perfectly clear to admins, so if you could explain both of those points it might be helpful.

:::::::What it means is in the examples given in parenthesis. And it means a mellower version of [[WP:DNIV]] mentioned by Cryptic. In fact  now it dawns on me that this suggestion is of general kind, applicable everywhere, so you are right, it should be clear for anyone who routinely handles disruption.

*The current wording is superior.  A block like this is always going to blow up in your face no matter what you put in the summary; that's a much more important idea to get across than a hypercondensed version of [[WP:DNIV]]. —[[User:Cryptic|Cryptic]] 07:34, 18 November 2015 (UTC)
